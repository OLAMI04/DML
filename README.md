## Business Problem
### Mounting Order Backlogs:
Our current routing and resource allocation processes have resulted in a growing backlog of orders, compromising delivery timelines and, in turn, customer satisfaction.
### Customer Frustration:
The increasing frequency of customer complaints regarding delayed deliveries and suboptimal communication channels is beginning to cast a shadow on our reputation for reliability.
### Visibility Gap: 
Customers often find themselves lacking real-time updates on their order progress, leading to communication gaps and rising dissatisfaction.
### Escalating Costs: 
Operational expenses are on the rise due to overtime payments and the necessity for expedited shipping to clear order backlogs.
## Rationale for the Project
Order Fulfillment is the process of receiving, processing, and delivering customer orders. It involves activities such as inventory management, order processing, picking and packing products, 
and shipping them to customers. While Backlogs in the context of order fulfillment refer to a situation where there is a delay or accumulation of unprocessed orders.
Backlogs can result from various factors, including high demand, operational inefficiencies, or unforeseen disruptions, and they can negatively impact customer satisfaction, as customers  
may experience delays in receiving their orders. Eliminating backlogs is crucial to ensuring timely and reliable order fulfillment.

Order fulfillment is the linchpin of our operations in the Logistics and Supply Chain industry, where efficiency is not merely a goal but a necessity. Let's delve into why this project is absolutely vital 
for Streamline Logistics Solutions:
